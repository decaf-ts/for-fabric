### Description

The @decaf-ts/for-fabric library provides a comprehensive integration layer between the DECAF framework and Hyperledger Fabric blockchain networks. It is designed to simplify the development of both client applications that interact with Fabric networks and chaincode (smart contracts) that run on those networks.

#### Client-Side Features

The client module offers a robust set of tools for connecting to and interacting with Fabric networks:

- **FabricAdapter**: Extends the CouchDBAdapter to provide a familiar interface for CRUD operations against Fabric chaincode. It handles connection management, transaction submission, and query evaluation.

- **FabricDispatch**: Listens for and processes events emitted by Fabric chaincode, enabling real-time updates and event-driven architectures.

- **Fabric File System Utilities**: Simplifies working with Fabric identities, certificates, and private keys, with support for both Node.js and browser environments.

#### Chaincode Features

The contracts module provides a framework for developing Fabric chaincode with TypeScript:

- **FabricContractAdapter**: Adapts the DECAF database interface to work within Fabric chaincode, providing access to the state database.

- **FabricContractRepository**: Implements the Repository pattern for Fabric chaincode, enabling model-driven data access.

- **FabricCrudContract**: An abstract base class that provides standard CRUD operations for chaincode models, reducing boilerplate code.

- **Event Handling**: Built-in support for emitting and handling chaincode events, facilitating communication between chaincode and client applications.

#### Integration with DECAF

This library seamlessly integrates with other DECAF components:

- Uses the decorator-validation library for model validation
- Extends the db-decorators framework for consistent data access
- Leverages the core DECAF patterns and abstractions

By providing a consistent interface across different storage technologies, @decaf-ts/for-fabric enables developers to write applications that can work with both traditional databases and blockchain ledgers with minimal code changes.
