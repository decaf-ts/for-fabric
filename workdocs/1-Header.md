## Hyperledger Fabric Contracts for DECAF

Chaincode-side building blocks for Hyperledger Fabric written in TypeScript. This module provides repositories, CRUD contracts (object and serialized JSON), an ERC20 sample contract, Fabric-backed sequences, event emission, and context-aware logging. It adapts DECAF’s data-access patterns to Fabric’s world-state so you can write smart contracts with the same Repository/Model abstractions used elsewhere in DECAF.
